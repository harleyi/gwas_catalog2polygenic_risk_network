This repository contains a tutorial with instructions for synthesizing GWAS results as a putative causal gene network. 
# Purpose
This tutorial is a walk-through for generating a putative causal gene network from EBI/NHGRI GWAS results. 

Main steps: 
#### 1. get genome-wide significant hits for a trait of interest from the GWAS catalog 
[https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas]
#### 2. annotate them (here we use published results from open targets genetics locus 2 gene pipeline)
[https://genetics.opentargets.org/]
#### 3. enter these genes into the string database. (Protein-Protein Interaction Networks & Functional Enrichment Analysis)
